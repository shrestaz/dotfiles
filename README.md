## This repository contains dotfiles (mostly bash profiles) for my linux setup.

### For Arch installs only! (if touchpad on the laptop is not working as expected)

Unless specified otherwise in the README, the locations of the dotfiles is the home directory.

For touchpad config, `sudo cp 30-touchpad.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/`
